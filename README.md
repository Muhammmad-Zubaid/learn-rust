# Learn Rust in Baby Steps

What is Rust?

Why are we learning Rust?

I am a web and mobile developer and teacher, therefore the first question that comes to mind is why am I learning Rust. The reason is that I am calculating that Web Assembly may be supported by all the major browsers by end of 2016. I think Web Assembly is a game changer both for Web and Mobile development. Initially Web Assembly will not support garbage collection semantics. Therefore, the only option left is C/C++ and Rust, both of them do not have garbage collection. Other languages like Java, C# or Swift all have garbage collection therefore will not be able to be used with Web Assembly in the initial stages. Right now Rust doesnot support Web Assembly either, however I am calculating that soon it will ( https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/33205 ). Furthermore, Rust will help me in becoming a systems programmer.
